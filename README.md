# http-response-code

first use chmod 755 to give the file permission to run.
As you can see, I used the code to fetch a txt file and bring in numerous urls data, this way it is better to visualize the http code

to run the code just type:

```bash
./get-response.sh urls.txt
```

for future improvements could put a routine in slack that shows from time to time
